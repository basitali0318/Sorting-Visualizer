# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a Sorting Visualizer built using C++, SDL2 for graphical representation, and integrates various sorting algorithms to visually demonstrate their sorting mechanisms on a set of random data.

## Features

- Visualization of several sorting algorithms in real-time.
- Algorithms include Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Shell Sort.
- Interactive controls to randomize data, select sorting algorithms, and observe their sorting process visually.
- Utilizes SDL2 for rendering graphical representations of sorting.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- C++ Compiler (GCC recommended)
- SDL2 Library installed on your system

## Installing Sorting Visualizer

To install Sorting Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2.Navigate to the project directory and compile the project. For example, using `g++` with SDL2:
3. Run the compiled executable:
## Using Sorting Visualizer

Upon running the Sorting Visualizer, you will be greeted with an introduction and controls explanation. Use the keyboard controls as described to interact with the visualizer:

- `0`: Generate a new random list.
- `1` to `7`: Start different sorting algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap, Shell Sort respectively).
- `q`: Exit the Sorting Visualizer.
